# Project design and implementation
- link UML Diagram for my project

- First I modify ball.py to be more easy to understand for me and delete some method that I don't need to use in my project. For the paddle.py I have change nothing from base line code because in I need to use the paddle in my project. For the last one is ball_collect_game.py, I delete method that I don't need to use and add some method to create more game features in my project.
- I use breakpoint to debug my code and finally my code is working correctly 100% as I expected it to be.

# Rate my project sophistication level
I think I rate sophistication level for 100 because I am a slow learner so I have to took long time to understand all the base line code. It make me to try hard to complete my project.
